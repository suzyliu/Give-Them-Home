While their basic needs may be similar, different breeds of dogs have very different emotional needs. If you have a Terrier, for example, he will love digging, whereas a Scenthound would prefer to follow a trail to a hidden stash! A Livestock Protection dog may be happy on his own for long periods of time, but a Toy Dog needs lots more attention from you to feel content. These very different behavioural differences between the breeds, and the different dog personalities can come from the different working roles dogs originally played over the years.
